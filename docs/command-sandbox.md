# Design — Sandboxing the `RunCommand` effect (Phase 6)

**Status:** implemented. Design + record for [crucible-application.md §7.4](./crucible-application.md#L436)
and [§9 Phase 6](./crucible-application.md#L634) — the *required*, definition-of-done phase. The
sandbox mechanism is built and validated (§9 steps 1–5 done, gate §10 green — incl. the full LLM
e2e passing under the launcher); Crucible runs confined by default. Open items are orthogonal to the
sandbox (§11): a shared-`Cargo.toml` feature race that lost one of three instructions, and per-run
`CARGO_HOME`/tightening follow-ups.

**One-line summary.** Every command run through the `RunCommand` effect compiles and/or runs
LLM-authored *native* code (§7.2). Today that runs with the full ambient environment of the
AutoProver process. Phase 6 confines each such command — with no network, no inherited secrets, and
only its own inputs on the filesystem — using **unprivileged, in-process kernel sandboxing
(Landlock + seccomp)** that needs no container changes, no namespaces, no capabilities, and no
custom runtime. It is a single wrapper around [`run_local_command`](../composer/sandbox/command.py).
Done is proven by an escape test.

---

## 1. Why this is required, not optional

The outer AutoProver container protects the *host* from AutoProver. It does **not** protect
AutoProver's own secrets, network access, and filesystem from code running *inside* it. And the
`RunCommand` effect deliberately runs untrusted native code:

- `cargo build-sbf` on the **user-supplied program** compiles it natively — running its
  `build.rs`, its proc-macros, and (for a future Prover/CVLR backend) LLM-munged source.
- `crucible run` compiles the **LLM-authored harness** (its `setup()`, `action_*`, `build.rs`)
  and then runs it as a native LiteSVM-in-process binary (§7.2 — verified native, no SVM sandbox).

So arbitrary code of the LLM's (and the analyzed program's) choosing executes with whatever
ambient authority the AutoProver process has: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CERTORA*` cloud tokens,
`AWS_*`, `PG*`, the network route to `169.254.169.254`, and the entire bind-mounted host project.
The trust boundary from §7.2 ("the LLM authors only file *contents*, never argv") stops the LLM
from choosing *what command runs* — it does nothing about what that command, once running, can
*reach*. That is this phase's job.

Until this phase is green the backend may run only in a trusted, offline environment on trusted
input (the gate scenario). This is the definition of done.

---

## 2. Threat model

| | |
|---|---|
| **Asset** | AutoProver's ambient secrets (LLM/cloud API keys, DB creds), its network egress (incl. `169.254.169.254` metadata → IAM role creds on EC2), and host files outside the command's declared inputs. |
| **Adversary** | Native code the LLM authored (harness `setup`/`action`/`build.rs`) **and** native code in the analyzed program (its `build.rs`, proc-macros) that `cargo build-sbf` runs. Assume it is actively hostile and knows it is being fuzzed. |
| **Trust boundary** | The process boundary of each `RunCommand` invocation. Inside: untrusted. Outside: the trusted AutoProver process. `program`+`args` are trusted (Rust decider / Python build step author them, §7.2); only the *files* are untrusted. |
| **Assumptions** | (1) The outer container/host is the infrastructure's boundary against the host machine and other tenants (on EC2, the Nitro hypervisor) — this phase is the boundary *within* the container, between AutoProver and its own untrusted child. (2) The kernel is patched and Landlock-capable (§8). (3) The host toolchains we grant read access are trusted. |
| **Non-goals** | Protecting the host machine *from the container* (the infrastructure does that). A full VM boundary between AutoProver and the child (that is what gVisor/Kata/VM-per-run would add at the infra layer, orthogonal to this phase — §6). Defending against a malicious *`program`/`args`* — those are trusted by construction (§7.2). |

**Explicit guarantees the sandbox must provide:**

1. **No network** — no egress at all, including DNS and `169.254.169.254`.
2. **No secrets** — the child's environment is a scrubbed allowlist, and it cannot recover
   AutoProver's secrets out-of-band (via `/proc/<parent>/environ` or `ptrace` — see §6, the
   same-uid caveats).
3. **Minimal filesystem** — only the command's own inputs are writable; toolchains are read-only;
   nothing else of the host is readable.
4. **Resource caps + wall-clock kill** — memory / CPU-time / pids / file-size bounded; a hung or
   runaway command is killed.
5. **Offline, code-exec-free dependency resolution** — all network dep-fetching happens *outside*
   the sandbox and *before* any untrusted code runs (§5); the sandboxed build is `--offline`.

---

## 3. What runs inside, and what it legitimately needs

The hard part of sandboxing a compiler+fuzzer is that it needs a *lot* of real toolchain — the
sandbox is only useful if it grants exactly that and nothing more. The three command shapes and
their real needs:

| Command | Reads (grant **ro+x**) | Writes (grant **rw**) | Network |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo build-sbf <program>` | rust toolchain (`RUSTUP_HOME`), solana platform-tools (the sBPF toolchain), warm cargo registry (`CARGO_HOME/registry`), program crate source | program crate `target/` | none (offline) |
| `crucible run <prog> <test> …` | the `crucible` binary + its libs, rust toolchain, cargo registry, the **crucible checkout crates** (path deps from `CrucibleDep`, §6.1), the built `.so` + IDL | the harness crate `target/`, corpus/output dirs | none (offline) |
| `cargo build` (harness, if run directly) | as above | harness `target/` | none (offline) |

Common surface, resolved once at sandbox-config time and expressed as Landlock rules (§6):

- **Rust toolchain** — `RUSTUP_HOME` (default `~/.rustup`), `cargo`/`rustc` shims — read+exec.
- **Cargo home** — shared `CARGO_HOME` (default `~/.cargo`): only **`bin/`** is granted read+exec
  (the `cargo` / `cargo-*` shims on `PATH`). The home **root is not granted**, so
  `credentials.toml` / private-registry tokens stay unreadable. Offline registry contents live in
  the private per-run `CARGO_HOME` under the workdir (§11 item 5), warmed *outside* (§5).
- **Solana platform-tools** — cargo-build-sbf's sBPF rust toolchain — read+exec.
- **The `crucible` binary** and libs it dlopens — read+exec.
- **The crucible checkout** (`$CRUCIBLE_REPO/crates/…`) — the path deps — read-only.
- **System runtime** — `/usr`, `/bin`, `/lib`, `/lib64` — read+exec (needed for the toolchain's own
  dynamic linking and subprocesses).
- **Device nodes** — `/dev/null`, `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/tty` — read+write. The toolchain
  opens these constantly (a build *fails* without `/dev/null` — validated during step 2). Landlock
  rules can target individual files, so we grant these specific nodes rather than the whole `/dev`
  tree; either way `mknod` stays blocked (no capability), so no new devices can be created.
- **Workdir** — the crate tree + `target/` + corpus/output — the primary read-write grant.
- **A private temp dir** — `<workdir>/.sandbox_tmp`, with `TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP` pointed at it. The
  **linker** writes scratch files to `$TMPDIR` (default `/tmp`) during `cargo build`; we do *not*
  grant the shared `/tmp` (it may hold host/other-run secrets and would defeat the escape test), so a
  per-run temp under the already-writable workdir is redirected in. (A fresh harness build fails at
  the link step — "Cannot create temporary file in /tmp/" — without this; found via the e2e gate.)
- **A private cargo home** — `<workdir>/.sandbox_cargo`, with `CARGO_HOME` pointed at it (§11 item 5).
  The offline `cargo build` writes there (source extraction, locks); keeping it per-run means
  untrusted build code can't poison a *shared* `~/.cargo` (which stays read-only, for the `cargo`
  binary). The warm step (§5) fetches into this same home.

Everything else — the rest of the bind-mounted project, `/etc`, `/proc/<other-pids>`, `$HOME`, the
process environment — is **not granted**, therefore inaccessible. Confinement is default-deny.

> The exact host paths (`RUSTUP_HOME`, platform-tools dir, crucible binary) are **resolved by the
> host at config time**, not hardcoded — see the `SandboxPolicy` in §7. They are discovered from the
> environment the same way `resolve_crucible_repo` already discovers the checkout.

## 4. The seam — one function, unchanged signature

All command execution already funnels through
[`run_local_command`](../composer/sandbox/command.py) (both the IoC `RunCommand` effect via
[`RealEffects.run_command`](../composer/rustapp/adapter.py#L120) and the Solana build step
[`build_program`](../composer/spec/solana/build.py)). It lives in the backend-agnostic
[`composer/sandbox`](../composer/sandbox/) package — outside `rustapp` — so Python-based backends can
run confined commands too, not just the Rust-IoC ones. The sandbox wraps exactly this one function.

**The mechanism sits behind a `SandboxProvider` seam, so it is swappable.** `run_local_command`
never names a concrete tool. It holds a **tool-agnostic `SandboxPolicy`** (the *intent*: rw paths,
ro paths, env allowlist, rlimits, network-off — §7) and a `SandboxProvider` that translates that
intent into a concrete launch:

```python
class SandboxProvider(Protocol):
    def wrap(self, policy: SandboxPolicy, program: str, args: list[str]) -> LaunchSpec: ...
    def available(self) -> Availability: ...   # drives fail-closed (§7)

# run_local_command, unchanged shape:
spec = provider.wrap(policy, program, args)
create_subprocess_exec(*spec.argv, cwd=workdir, env=spec.env, …)
```

The first provider is our **custom launcher shim** (§6): `LaunchSpec.argv == ["run-confined",
*policy_argv, "--", program, *args]`, all authored by trusted Python (never the LLM). Swapping to an
off-the-shelf tool later — `landrun`, `sandlock` — is a *new `SandboxProvider` implementation that
maps the same `SandboxPolicy` to that tool's flags*; the policy, this seam, `run_local_command`,
`RealEffects`, and the escape-test gate (§10) are all untouched. The provider is chosen by config
(`CommandConfig` / an env var), defaulting to the custom launcher. The `none` provider is a
passthrough (`argv == [program, *args]`) — byte-for-byte today's behavior for the EVM/Foundry paths
and explicit trusted-input dev runs.

Nothing in the Rust decider, the ABI, the driver, or the artifact store changes — this is why §7.4
could defer it to last.

Two properties `run_local_command` *already* enforces stay in force and are the first line of
defense (the sandbox is the second): the command runs via **exec, not a shell**, and every written
file path is **confined to the workdir** (`_confined_target`). The sandbox does not replace these;
it assumes them.

---

## 5. Offline dependency resolution — split fetch (network, no exec) from build (exec, no network)

The tension: `cargo build` needs its dependency crates, but the sandbox has no network. Resolution
splits cleanly along the code-execution line:

- **`cargo fetch` / `cargo vendor` download but never run build scripts** — no untrusted code
  executes during fetch. So the *fetch* happens **outside** the sandbox, with network, as a trusted
  prep step, warming `CARGO_HOME/registry` (or producing a vendored dir + source-replacement
  config).
- **`cargo build` runs build scripts and proc-macros** — this is where untrusted code executes, so
  it happens **inside** the sandbox, `--offline`, against the already-warm cache.

The harness `Cargo.toml` is **host-owned** (`CrucibleDep.render_deps`, pinned versions, §6.1), so
its dep graph is fixed and vendorable deterministically. The program-under-test's `Cargo.toml` is
user-supplied, but `cargo fetch` on it is still exec-free, so the same split holds for the build-sbf
step. This also closes the build-time supply-chain vector: with offline + a pre-warmed cache, a
malicious `build.rs` cannot pull a payload at build time.

**Implementation (step 4).** "Offline inside" is one env var, not per-tool flags: the policy sets
**`CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=1`** in the child env, which forces *every* cargo invocation offline — including
the nested `cargo` that `crucible run` spawns to build the harness — so we never thread `--offline`
through each tool ([recipes.py](../composer/sandbox/recipes.py), `offline=True` default). "Fetch
outside" is [`warm_cargo_cache`](../composer/spec/solana/build.py) — a `cargo fetch` run *unsandboxed*
(no provider → network on) before the confined build; `build_program` calls it before the sandboxed
`cargo build-sbf`. The harness crate has its own deps (libafl, litesvm, …), so it needs its own warm
at manifest-assembly time; wiring that exact call site (and confirming whether `CARGO_HOME` must be
granted rw for cargo's build-time source extraction, or pre-extracted during the warm) lands with the
gate in step 5, where a real offline build proves it. All of this is inert until a sandbox is enabled.

---

## 6. Mechanism: unprivileged Landlock + seccomp self-sandboxing

### Why not a namespace sandbox (bwrap/nsjail) or gVisor

The obvious tools (bwrap, nsjail) build the sandbox out of **namespaces** (user + mount + net +
pid), then `pivot_root` into a minimal filesystem. That model **fights the container**: creating an
unprivileged user namespace and mounting inside it is exactly what Docker's default seccomp +
AppArmor block. Validated empirically (python:3.12-slim, host kernel 7.0.11, `bwrap 0.11.0`, uid
1000):

| Approach under Docker defaults | Outcome |
|---|---|
| unprivileged `bwrap` | ✗ userns creation blocked by default **seccomp** |
| `bwrap`, `seccomp=unconfined` | ✗ `mount --make-rslave` blocked by **AppArmor** `docker-default` |
| `bwrap`, `seccomp=unconfined`+`apparmor=unconfined` | ✓ works — but requires **weakening the whole container's LSMs** (rejected) |
| setuid `bwrap` | ✗ `capset` blocked (Docker capability bounding set drops `CAP_SETPCAP`) |

Making bwrap work would mean either **stripping the container's own seccomp/AppArmor** (widening the
host-kernel attack surface across *all* of AutoProver — the opposite of what a sandboxing phase
should do) or running AutoProver under a **gVisor/Kata** runtime. gVisor works, but (a) it imposes
its *heaviest* overhead precisely on our syscall/I/O-bound compile+fuzz workload, and (b) its benefit
— protecting the host kernel — is an *infrastructure* boundary that on EC2 is already provided by the
Nitro hypervisor. Neither is worth coupling this phase to a deployment decision.

### The chosen model: the process sandboxes itself

Instead of building a new namespace *around* the command, the command **restricts itself** using two
unprivileged kernel facilities — the model Chrome, OpenSSH, and systemd use. Both need **no
namespaces, no capabilities, no root, and no `--security-opt`**, and both work in a **stock**
container. Validated (stock python:3.12-slim, uid 1000, Docker default profile):

| Guarantee | Probe result | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| filesystem — write outside workdir | ✗ `EACCES` | **Landlock** (full ABI FS bit set, grant only workdir rw) |
| filesystem — read host file outside grants | ✗ `EACCES` | Landlock (no grant); note `/etc` *is* granted for NSS — escape gate uses a planted host file, not `/etc/passwd` |
| filesystem — cargo `credentials.toml` | ✗ `EACCES` | policy grants shared cargo **`bin/` only**, never the home root |
| **secret** — read `/proc/<parent>/environ` | ✗ `EACCES` | Landlock (no `/proc` grant) |
| **secret** — `ptrace(ATTACH, parent)` | ✗ `EPERM` | **seccomp** (deny `ptrace`, `process_vm_readv`) |
| network — `socket(AF_INET)` / netlink / vsock | ✗ `EPERM` | seccomp: deny `socket` when domain **≠ `AF_UNIX`** |
| network — `io_uring_setup` (seccomp bypass) | ✗ `EPERM` | seccomp: deny `io_uring_{setup,enter,register}` |
| network — x32-ABI `socket` (seccomp bypass) | ✗ `EPERM` | seccomp: each deny mirrored onto its x32 syscall number (`nr \| 0x4000_0000`) |
| network — TCP via Landlock (defense-in-depth) | ✗ deny | Landlock net rules (ABI ≥4), no bind/connect grants |
| same-uid — `kill(parent)` / abstract UDS | ✗ `EPERM` | Landlock **scopes** `Signal` + `AbstractUnixSocket` (ABI ≥6 / Linux ≥6.12) |
| legitimate — write workdir, `exec` toolchain, `AF_UNIX` | ✓ works | Landlock rw grant + r+x on toolchain paths; `AF_UNIX` still allowed |

- **[Landlock](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html)** (LSM; Linux ≥5.13, we observed
  ABI **8**) — an unprivileged process installs a filesystem ruleset on itself: default-deny, then
  grant rw to the workdir and read+exec to the toolchain paths of §3, handling the *full* set of FS
  access rights the running ABI supports (else unhandled operations stay unrestricted). This is what
  confines reads *and* writes and — crucially — closes the `/proc/<parent>/environ` leak that a user
  namespace would otherwise have closed for free. On ABI ≥6 it also installs **scopes** (signals +
  abstract Unix sockets). On ABI ≥4 with network off it default-denies Landlock TCP bind/connect
  (defense-in-depth next to seccomp; UDP is still seccomp-only).
- **seccomp-BPF self-filter** (`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` + `SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER`) — installing a
  *stricter* filter on yourself is unprivileged and permitted by Docker's default profile. It denies
  `socket` for every domain **except `AF_UNIX`** (so TCP, UDP/DNS, IMDS, netlink, vsock, … are
  blocked while cargo's jobserver still works), denies **`io_uring_*`** (the classic way to create
  sockets without calling `socket(2)`), and denies the remaining same-uid secret vectors
  (`ptrace`, `process_vm_readv`/`writev`). On **x86_64** each deny is **mirrored onto its x32-ABI
  syscall number** (`nr | 0x4000_0000`): the x32 calling convention runs under the same
  `AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64` identity, so seccompiler's arch guard passes it through, and without the mirror
  an x32-tagged `socket`/`io_uring`/`ptrace` would miss the exact-number rules and reach
  default-allow — a full bypass (which libseccomp guards against automatically; seccompiler does not).
  Still a **deny-list** on top of default-allow — not a full syscall allowlist; residual risk is
  tracked in §11.
- **env allowlist** — the launcher `execve`s with a scrubbed environment (PATH, HOME, CARGO_HOME,
  RUSTUP_HOME, TERM, and benign build vars only). The `--clearenv` equivalent, done in-process.
- **rlimits** — `setrlimit` for `RLIMIT_AS` / `RLIMIT_CPU` / `RLIMIT_NPROC` / `RLIMIT_FSIZE` (§7).

Landlock and seccomp are **preserved across `execve`** (with `NO_NEW_PRIVS`) and **inherited across
`fork`**, so the launcher applies them once and every descendant — `cargo`, `rustc`, each `build.rs`,
the linker, the fuzz binary — runs confined.

### The same-uid caveat, and why it is closed

A user namespace (bwrap) would have run the child under a *remapped* uid, so cross-process access to
AutoProver was denied by credential mismatch. Self-sandboxing keeps the child at AutoProver's **own
uid**, so out-of-band vectors must be closed *explicitly*:

| Vector | Close | Floor |
|---|---|---|
| `/proc/<parent>/environ` | Landlock: no `/proc` grant | 5.13 |
| `ptrace` / `process_vm_*` | seccomp deny | any seccomp |
| `kill` / signals to parent | Landlock scope `Signal` | **6.12** (ABI 6) |
| abstract Unix sockets to outside | Landlock scope `AbstractUnixSocket` | **6.12** (ABI 6) |
| path-based Unix sockets | Landlock FS (socket inode must be under a grant) | 5.13 |
| readable secrets under toolchain paths | policy: grant shared cargo **`bin/` only**, not `~/.cargo` root (`credentials.toml`) | policy |

On kernels **below 6.12** the two scopes are BestEffort-dropped: signal and abstract-UDS remain a
**residual same-uid risk** (the child can still be killed by the wall-clock timeout; abstract
listeners are uncommon in the AutoProver container). Target AMI upgrades past 6.12 close them
fully; the escape suite asserts scopes only when the running kernel is ≥6.12.

### The launcher: a custom shim over audited crates (not hand-rolled primitives)

The first `SandboxProvider` (§4) is a small **trusted Rust launcher** (`run-confined`) that applies the
four confinements to itself, then `execve`s the command. It does **not** hand-write raw seccomp BPF
or raw Landlock syscalls — it composes two mature, permissively-licensed crates:

- **[`landlock`](https://crates.io/crates/landlock)** — the reference Rust binding; does ABI
  negotiation and the full FS access-right set (the fiddly part §11 Q1 warns about).
- **[`seccompiler`](https://crates.io/crates/seccompiler)** — the seccomp-BPF compiler from **AWS
  Firecracker**; we hand it a small allow/deny policy, not raw bytecode.

plus `setrlimit` and an env allowlist. So the security-sensitive primitives are audited upstream;
our code is the glue + the policy. We build Rust already, so this adds no new toolchain.

### Alternatives considered — and why the seam stays swappable (§4)

Two off-the-shelf tools do essentially this model. Neither is adopted *now*, but the `SandboxProvider`
seam means either can be dropped in later as a new provider mapping the same `SandboxPolicy`:

- **[`landrun`](https://github.com/zouuup/landrun)** (Go CLI, **MIT**, mature ~2.2k★, FS floor 5.13):
  excellent for Landlock FS + env, and the reference for our CLI shape. But it blocks network via
  **Landlock network rules (TCP-only, kernel ≥6.7)** — it does **not** block UDP/DNS, and degrades
  fail-open on older kernels — and has no rlimits. It would need a seccomp companion anyway, so it
  doesn't save the hard part.
- **[`sandlock`](https://github.com/multikernel/sandlock)** (Python+Rust, Landlock+seccomp): the
  closest match to our full model, but requires **kernel ≥6.12 (Landlock ABI v6)** — above Amazon
  Linux 2023's 6.1 — and ships an **unstated license** plus more surface than we need (MITM proxy,
  COW, notification supervisor). A strong candidate to revisit *if* the kernel-floor and license
  questions are resolved and reviewers prefer an off-the-shelf boundary.

The custom launcher wins for now on **kernel floor** (5.13, because we block network with seccomp not
Landlock), **license clarity**, and **minimal surface** — while the provider seam keeps the door open
to swap in `sandlock`/`landrun` with no change to the policy or the gate.

### The chief advantage: deployment-independence

Because it needs nothing from the container, the same code path runs identically on a dev laptop,
self-managed EC2, ECS, EKS, and even Fargate, and under `runc` or gVisor alike. **It decouples Phase
6 from the open deployment/tenancy questions** — those can be settled later as an *infrastructure*
hardening decision (VM-per-run / gVisor / IMDSv2 hop-limit / least-privilege IAM), layered *on top*
of this in-process boundary, not blocking it.

**Residual risk:** a Landlock/seccomp bypass or a kernel LPE would let the child reach the container
(and then only as far as the infrastructure boundary allows — the container, or on EC2 the Nitro
VM). Named; mitigated by keeping the kernel patched, by the env/network already being denied, and by
the orthogonal infra hardening above for higher-trust-risk deployments.

---

## 7. Resource limits, and the config surface

**Resource caps** are `setrlimit` calls the launcher makes on itself before `execve` (lowering your
own limits is unprivileged; inherited by all descendants): `RLIMIT_AS` (address space / memory-ish),
`RLIMIT_CPU` (CPU-seconds — a wall-clock-independent bound), `RLIMIT_NPROC` (fork-bomb guard),
`RLIMIT_FSIZE` (disk-fill guard). `RLIMIT_AS` is crude (address space, not RSS) but dependency-free;
a **cgroup v2** scope (`memory.max`, `pids.max`, `cpu.max`) is the robust upgrade if the container
grants writable cgroup delegation — note it, defer it. The existing asyncio `wait_for(...,
timeout_s)` in `run_local_command` stays the primary wall-clock kill.

The confinement *intent* is a **tool-agnostic** policy object (the same one every `SandboxProvider`
consumes, §4) — deliberately naming no mechanism, so a future provider swap needs no policy change:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SandboxPolicy:
    rw_paths: tuple[Path, ...]                # the workdir (+ any writable scratch)
    ro_paths: tuple[Path, ...]                # toolchains, crucible checkout, platform-tools, /usr…
    env_allowlist: Mapping[str, str]          # PATH, HOME, CARGO_HOME, RUSTUP_HOME, TERM, …
    network: bool = False                     # egress allowed? default off
    mem_bytes: int = ...
    cpu_seconds: int = ...
    nproc: int = ...
    fsize_bytes: int = ...
    # program + args come per-call from run_local_command
```

**Provider selection is separate config, not part of the policy** — a `CommandConfig.sandbox_provider`
knob (`"launcher"` = the custom Rust shim, default; `"none"` = passthrough; later `"landrun"` /
`"sandlock"`), overridable by env var. `run_local_command` gains `policy: SandboxPolicy | None` +
the resolved provider (default provider `"none"` when no policy, so existing callers and the EVM path
are unchanged). `RealEffects` builds the policy from a host-resolved config (toolchain paths
discovered like `resolve_crucible_repo` already does), and `build_program` uses the same.

**Fail-closed.** Before running under a real sandbox provider, `provider.available()` is checked
(for the launcher: Landlock is present *and* actually enforcing). If it isn't — or the provider cannot apply its
confinement — the command **refuses to run** rather than silently executing unconfined. The failure
is a **prominent, actionable message** naming the reason ("the command sandbox requires a
Landlock-capable kernel (Linux ≥5.13); this backend cannot run without it — see
docs/command-sandbox.md §8"). The `none` provider is a *separate*, explicit, logged choice for the
trusted EVM/Foundry callers and trusted-input dev runs — never reached as a fallback from a failed
sandbox setup.

---

## 8. Platform requirements — Linux with Landlock; nothing else supported

Landlock and seccomp are **Linux** facilities. This backend is supported only on a Linux host with a
**Landlock-capable kernel (≥5.13; ≥6.7 adds Landlock network rules as defense-in-depth)** — which
AutoProver's own container already provides (Amazon Linux 2023 = 6.1, recent Ubuntu, and the dev
container all qualify). **macOS is not a supported configuration** (team decision): there is no
Landlock, and no macOS-native equivalent is planned. A Mac developer runs this backend the way
AutoProver already runs — inside the Linux container.

If the sandbox cannot be established (non-Linux host, or a kernel without Landlock), the run
**fails immediately** with the §7 fail-closed message. This is the one uniform response everywhere
the sandbox is unavailable: refuse to run, loudly, rather than run untrusted native code unconfined.

---

## 9. Implementation plan

1. **The `SandboxProvider` seam + `SandboxPolicy`** — *done* ([composer/sandbox/policy.py](../composer/sandbox/policy.py)):
   the tool-agnostic policy (§7), the `SandboxProvider` protocol (`wrap` → `LaunchSpec`, `available`),
   the `none` passthrough provider, the name registry, and `ensure_available` / `SandboxUnavailable`.
   Pure, unit-tested. **This is the isolation layer that makes the mechanism swappable** — everything
   else depends only on this interface, never on a concrete tool. Lives in the backend-agnostic
   [`composer/sandbox`](../composer/sandbox/) package (with `run_local_command`), not under `rustapp`.
2. **The custom launcher provider** — *done*: the `run-confined` **trusted Rust binary**
   ([rust/run-confined](../rust/run-confined)) + the `LauncherProvider`
   ([composer/sandbox/launcher.py](../composer/sandbox/launcher.py)) that maps a
   `SandboxPolicy` to its argv. `run-confined --ro <path>… --rw <path>… --allow-env NAME[=VAL]…
   --rlimit-* … [--allow-network] -- <program> <args…>` sets rlimits + `NO_NEW_PRIVS`, builds the
   Landlock ruleset (best-effort ABI negotiation, full FS bit set, deny-by-default + §3 grants,
   scopes for signals/abstract UDS on ABI ≥6, TCP default-deny on ABI ≥4 when network is off) via
   the [`landlock`](https://crates.io/crates/landlock) crate, builds the seccomp filter (deny
   non-`AF_UNIX` sockets, `io_uring_*`, and ptrace/process_vm_*) via
   [`seccompiler`](https://crates.io/crates/seccompiler), applies both, then `execve`s the command
   with an env scrubbed to the allowlist. `--probe` builds a best-effort ruleset and reports whether
   Landlock actually *enforces* (not the numeric ABI, which the crate hides), driving `available()`
   → fail-closed (§7). Enforcement smoke-tested on the host (write-outside / planted host file /
   `/proc/<parent>/environ` / inet+io_uring+netlink sockets all denied; workdir write, AF_UNIX, and
   toolchain `exec` allowed); argv mapping golden-tested. Full escape gate is step 5.
3. **Thread `policy` + provider through `run_local_command`** — *done*: the runner accepts
   `provider`/`policy` (default `None` → the `none` passthrough, byte-for-byte today's behavior) and
   is fail-closed via `ensure_available`. A `SandboxConfig` ([composer/sandbox/config.py](../composer/sandbox/config.py))
   selects the provider (`$COMPOSER_SANDBOX_PROVIDER`, default `none`) and builds the policy via the
   `rust_build_policy` recipe ([composer/sandbox/recipes.py](../composer/sandbox/recipes.py) — the
   workdir and `/dev` nodes rw; discovered rust/cargo/platform-tool and system dirs ro, incl. `/etc`
   for NSS; env allowlist; network off). Threaded through `RealEffects` and `RustBackend`/`RustFormalizer`
   ([composer/rustapp/adapter.py](../composer/rustapp/adapter.py)), `build_program`
   ([composer/spec/solana/build.py](../composer/spec/solana/build.py)), and the Crucible pipeline
   (which adds the crucible checkout + binary to `extra_ro`). Integration-tested: `run_local_command`
   under the launcher denies out-of-workdir reads and network while allowing the workdir + toolchain.
4. **Offline prep (§5)** — *done*: `warm_cargo_cache` (a `cargo fetch` run outside the sandbox,
   network on) warms the registry, and the policy sets `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=1` so the confined build —
   and the nested cargo `crucible run` spawns — run offline. Wired into `build_program`; the
   harness-dir warm is `CrucibleArtifactStore.warm_dependencies`, called from `prepare_formalization`
   after the manifest is placed when a sandbox is on. `CARGO_HOME` is granted rw (the crucible policy)
   so cargo can extract crate sources offline.
5. **The escape-test gate (§10)** — *done*, and **Crucible's default provider is now `launcher`**
   (`_crucible_sandbox`; override with `COMPOSER_SANDBOX_PROVIDER=none`). Validated:
   - **Part A (escape suite) — green** ([tests/test_sandbox_escape.py](../tests/test_sandbox_escape.py)):
     a `rustc`-compiled malicious program run through the real launcher has every vector *denied*
     (secret env, `/proc/<ppid>/environ`, host file outside the workdir, external TCP, and
     `169.254.169.254`), with an unconfined control confirming the leaks would otherwise happen.
   - **Part B — green**: a real `cargo-build-sbf` of `solana_vault` under the launcher (offline,
     confined) produces the `.so` ([tests/test_crucible_sandbox_gate.py](../tests/test_crucible_sandbox_gate.py)
     — this caught the relative-policy-path bug; grants must be absolute), and a real
     `crucible run --dry-run` under the launcher builds the harness *offline* and runs LiteSVM
     (`Harness validation passed!`).
   - **Full LLM vertical — green**: the e2e gate (`tests/test_crucible_e2e_gate.py`) passes under the
     launcher (`COMPOSER_SANDBOX_PROVIDER=launcher`): analysis → 23 properties → shared fixture
     authored → per-instruction harness build + fuzz, all confined + offline, with **all three
     instructions (initialize / deposit / withdraw) delivered with fuzz verdicts** (`BAD` —
     counterexamples found). Getting here required the `/tmp` fix below and the shared-crate
     concurrency fix (§11 item 8); before the latter, `initialize` was dropped to a `Cargo.toml`
     feature race.

   **Root cause found via the gate:** every fresh harness build initially failed at the *link* step —
   `Cannot create temporary file in /tmp/: Permission denied` (the linker's `$TMPDIR` scratch, which
   the policy didn't grant). A link failure reads as "could not compile", so the LLM kept rewriting a
   fine fixture. Fixed by redirecting `TMPDIR` to a private `<workdir>/.sandbox_tmp` (§3) rather than
   granting the shared `/tmp`. The `RunCommand` failure logging added alongside the authoring
   improvements is what surfaced it.

Each step is behind the seam, so the earlier Phase 1–5 gates keep passing. **Prerequisite of the
flip:** `run-confined` must be on PATH (built into the Docker image; `cargo build -p run-confined
--release` in dev) — otherwise Crucible fail-closes (§7/§8). A later off-the-shelf swap
(`landrun`/`sandlock`) is *only* a new step-2-style provider — the seam, policy, and gate are
untouched.

---

## 10. The gate — an escape test

A new expensive gate (`tests/test_crucible_sandbox_gate.py`) with two halves:

**A. Escape attempts are denied.** Author a *malicious* harness whose `setup()` (and a companion
`build.rs`) attempts, and record the outcome of each:

- **Read a planted secret** — set a fake `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=canary-<nonce>` in AutoProver's env
  before the run; the harness (a) reads `std::env::var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")` and (b) tries to read
  it out-of-band from `/proc/<ppid>/environ`, writing whatever it finds to a workdir file. Assert
  the value is **absent** by both routes.
- **Read a host file outside the workdir** — the harness tries to open `/etc/passwd` and a file in
  the real project root *outside* the granted workdir. Assert **permission denied**.
- **Reach the network** — the harness tries to connect to an external host **and** to
  `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (the EC2 metadata endpoint → IAM creds). Assert **both
  fail** (socket creation denied). Also: `io_uring_setup` (seccomp bypass), `socket(AF_NETLINK)`,
  `socket(AF_VSOCK)` — all denied; `socket(AF_UNIX)` still allowed.
- **Same-uid control plane** (when kernel ≥6.12) — `kill(parent, 0)` and connect to an abstract
  Unix socket owned outside the sandbox are denied (Landlock scopes).
- **Cargo credentials** — a planted `credentials.toml` under the shared cargo home is **not**
  readable (policy grants `bin/` only).

The harness must not be able to fail the assertions silently — it writes each probe's result into
the workdir (allowed) and the test reads them back, asserting every probe reports *denied*.

**B. The legitimate path still works.** The existing `solana_vault` gate ([§8](./crucible-application.md#L545))
passes **unchanged** under the launcher provider — the shared fixture is authored, the `.so` builds,
tests compile and fuzz, verdicts are produced. This proves the sandbox grants exactly the toolchain
the real work needs and nothing more.

Because the gate is written against the `SandboxProvider` seam (§4), not a specific tool, it doubles
as the **conformance test any future provider must pass** — swapping in `landrun`/`sandlock` means
re-running this same gate green, nothing more.

Only when both halves are green may the backend run on untrusted input (the §9 definition of done).

---

## 11. Open questions

1. **Landlock ABI coverage / negotiation.** The launcher must handle the full FS access-right set of
   the *running* kernel's ABI (unhandled rights stay unrestricted) with best-effort fallback on older
   kernels. The `landlock` crate does this; confirm the minimum supported ABI on our target AMIs and
   what "best-effort" degrades to (e.g. pre-ABI-3 has no `TRUNCATE` handling).
2. **AF_UNIX-only socket allow (done for hostile domains).** seccomp now denies `socket` when
   domain **≠ `AF_UNIX`** (so netlink/vsock/packet are closed too) and denies `io_uring_*`. Confirm
   the toolchain (cargo jobserver, rustc, linker) never needs another domain; if a benign
   `AF_NETLINK` use surfaces, decide whether to allow it narrowly. Full syscall **allowlist**
   (default-deny) remains a possible hardening step if the deny-list residual risk is unacceptable.
   **x32-ABI bypass — closed.** A deny-list keyed on exact x86_64 syscall numbers was bypassable via
   the x32 ABI (same `AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64`, number OR'd with `0x4000_0000`): the arch guard passes and
   the exact-number rules miss, hitting default-allow. Critical because on kernels < 6.7 (e.g. the
   AL2023 6.1 target) Landlock provides *no* network filtering, so seccomp is the sole network
   control. Fixed by mirroring every deny onto its x32 number (`apply_seccomp`), regression-tested in
   `tests/test_sandbox_escape.py` (asserts the x32 `socket` is denied with `EPERM` from seccomp, not
   `ENOSYS` from the kernel). This is the deny-list's one arch-level hole; a full allowlist would also
   close it structurally.
3. **rlimits vs cgroup v2 (§7).** Is `RLIMIT_AS` enough to contain a memory-hungry fuzzer, or do we
   need cgroup `memory.max` (and thus writable cgroup delegation in the container) sooner?
4. **Cache warming cost (§5).** Per-run `cargo fetch` adds latency; is a shared, pre-warmed
   read-only registry volume worth it for CI throughput?
5. **Per-run `CARGO_HOME` — done.** An offline `cargo build` *writes* to `CARGO_HOME` (extracts crate
   sources, takes locks), and that build runs untrusted `build.rs`/proc-macro code — so a writable
   *shared* `~/.cargo` was a cross-run poisoning surface (overwrite an extracted `registry/src` to
   hit a later run). Fixed: `rust_build_policy` points `CARGO_HOME` at a **private per-run dir under
   the workdir** (`sandbox_cargo_home` → `<workdir>/.sandbox_cargo`), the warm step (`warm_cargo_cache`,
   unsandboxed) fetches *into that same home*, and the shared cargo home is granted **read-only on
   `bin/` only** (`shared_cargo_ro_paths`) — never the home root, so `credentials.toml` cannot be
   read by untrusted code. Untrusted writes touch only the run's throwaway cache. Validated: a fresh
   fetch into an empty private home + a confined offline build succeed. **Remaining cost:** deps are
   re-fetched per run (no shared writable cache); a shared *read-only* index/cache to avoid the
   re-download is the deferred optimization (add specific cache subtrees to `shared_cargo_ro_paths`,
   still not the home root).
6. **Off-the-shelf provider swap (deferred, seam is ready — §4/§6).** `sandlock` (needs kernel
   ≥6.12; unstated license) or `landrun` (+ a seccomp companion for UDP/DNS + rlimits) could replace
   the custom launcher as a new `SandboxProvider` if reviewers prefer an off-the-shelf boundary. Blocked
   today on the kernel-floor (target AMI ≥6.12?) and license questions; revisit once those resolve.
   The provider seam + the gate-as-conformance-test (§10) make the swap mechanical.
7. **Infra-layer hardening (orthogonal, non-blocking).** Independent of this in-process boundary,
   deployments running genuinely untrusted programs should also apply the standard EC2 hardening —
   least-privilege instance IAM role, IMDSv2 with hop limit 1, egress-restricted security group, and
   (if desired) VM-per-run or a gVisor runtime. Decide per deployment when the tenancy model is
   settled; none of it blocks Phase 6.
8. **Shared-`Cargo.toml`/`main.rs` race (crucible backend) — fixed.** The per-component sessions
   share one `fuzz/<prog>/` crate; concurrent runs raced on both files (the observed
   "package does not contain this feature: `c_<slug>`" that dropped `initialize`, and a latent
   `main.rs` clobber). Fixed two ways: `prepare_component` now reserves Cargo features
   **cumulatively** (the manifest only grows, so no feature is lost), and per-component command runs
   are **serialized + atomic** (`run_local_command` materializes files and runs as one unit under a
   `Semaphore(1)` shared by `RustFormalizer`), while the LLM authoring turns still run concurrently.
   The remaining parallelism win — concurrent *builds/fuzzing* — needs a crate-per-component (§10 Q1);
   deferred.
