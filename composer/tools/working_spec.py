    rigor (via ``use_working_spec=True``) to confirm that the changes present

    specification or make large scale changes unless the user has explicitly
    approved these changes via the human_in_the_loop tool. Do *NOT* request
    changes that significantly weaken the specification or otherwise trivialize it.

    NB once the working spec has been committed to the VFS, it is discarded.
    Committing does NOT by itself produce a prover verification stamp — after a
    successful commit you still need to run ``certora_prover`` against the
    committed spec (with ``use_working_spec=False`` and the same
    ``target_spec=target_path``) to record the stamp.
