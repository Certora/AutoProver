class SpecChangeProposalArgs(WithToolCallId):
    """
    Propose a change to the specification. There are two legitimate use cases for calling this tool.

    You may use this tool to propose the addition of *summaries*, by updating (or adding) the `methods` block,
    and adding any ancilliary definitions.

    Summaries are used to (effectively) replace the body of a function with the given "summary". This summary may
    be a declaration that the return value of the function should be treated as nondeterminstic, a havoc, or a CVL expression.

    Summaries are typically used when a function is too difficult to reason about directly; this complexity may
    come from non-linear operations, complex inter-contract interactions, or bitwise operations.

    When possible, the summary should be *sound*, that is, the behavior that replaces the function should *over-approximate* the
    function implementation. For example of an *unsound* summary, summarizing a function called `mulDiv(uint,uint)` to simply
    return 0 is unsound. A *sound* summary for `mulDiv(uint,uint)` would be to return a non-deterministic number, as
    this admits "more" behaviors than the exact `mulDiv` implementation.

    However, there may be cases where a summary *can* be used to elide behavior that is not relevant to the properties being
    proven. For example, if the property being verified relates to interest fee calculation, and a function simply emits
    logs, it may be appropriate to "summarize away" the log emmission function.

    The other use case is when the user has approved any other change discussed via the human_in_the_loop tool.
    For example, if the human agrees that the spec is ambiguous, or needs changing, use this tool to propose
    the minimal necessary change to the spec file.

    A human will review this request, and either respond with `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED: ...`, or `REFINE: ...`.
    `ACCEPTED` means the proposed spec file will be used for all future Certora Prover runs.
    `REJECTED` means the proposed change should be discarded, with an explanation as to why the change is
    not appropriate. You should incorporate this explanation when considering proposed changes.
    
    `REFINE` indicates that the change proposal should be adjusted according to the given feedback and then re-proposed.
