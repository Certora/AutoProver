    """
    Invoke the Certora Prover, a powerful symbolic reasoning tool for verifying the correctness of smart contracts.

    The Certora Prover operates on one or more smart contracts files, and a specification for their behavior, written in a domain
    specific language called CVL, for which you have the documentation. A specification for the code you are generating
    has been provided for you, and is composed of multiple `rules`. Each rule defines the acceptable behavior
    of the smart contract in terms of assertions; a violated assertion means the smart contract's behavior is
    unacceptable.

    The Certora Prover will automatically check whether a smart contract instance (the "contract under verifiction")
    satisfies the provided specification on a per rule basis.

    For each rule, the prover will give one of the following result:
    1. VERIFIED: the smart contract satisfies the rule for all possible inputs
    2. VIOLATED: The smart contract violates the specification. As part of this result, the prover will provide
    a concrete counter example for the input/states which lead to the violation
    3. TIMEOUT: The automated reasoning used by the prover timed out before giving a response either way
    4. SANITY_FAIL: The rule succeeded, but was vacuously true, perhaps due to too specific requirements
    5. ERROR/other: There was some internal error within the prover

    When there are large numbers of failures, these result may be truncated. If this occurs, a summary of results from
    the prover will be provided.

      argument. Thus, if verifying `MyContract`, only `src/MyContract.sol` needs to be provided here.
      HOWEVER: any files necessary to the compilation of `MyContract` must also have been placed on the
