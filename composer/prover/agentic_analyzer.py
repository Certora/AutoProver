"""Agentic CEX analyzer for the codegen workflow.

Replaces single-shot per-rule analysis (``TrivialFanoutCexHandler``) with
two layered sub-agents:

1. **Per-rule analyzer** — runs once per failing CEX, with a Python-side
   scratchpad shared across all CEXes for the same rule. Each invocation
   commits to a discriminated union: either match an existing scratchpad
   entry (with evidence) or open a new entry (with text + evidence).
   This amortizes cost across parametric instances of the same rule
   (CEX 2 of rule foo can match CEX 1's root cause without re-deriving)
   while structurally preventing lazy over-clustering — the model must
   point at a specific prior entry and articulate evidence to merge.

2. **Cross-rule aggregator** — runs once after all per-rule passes, sees
   the union of per-CEX analyses across rules, partitions them into
   ``K`` ``AnalyzedDiagnosis`` records. Bias mitigation: aggregator runs
   fresh on per-CEX texts; may un-group within a rule if the analysis
   texts diverge enough.

Both agents read source via fs tools scoped to the prover's report
directory (the materialized VFS containing only the source files
compiled into this verification run). No write access. No access to the
codegen author's broader VFS — the analyzer should not be answering
"what does the design intend"; it should be reasoning from the trace
and the actual source compiled into the verification problem.

Re-read the draft above and check, before delivering:

- Does every input root-cause index appear in EXACTLY ONE partition?
  Missing indices and double-counted indices both make the result

- Did you err toward more partitions when uncertain? The failure mode is
  over-grouping — two per-rule causes sharing a vague label like
  "missing invariant" are SEPARATE partitions when the invariants
  differ.
- Is each partition's `diagnosis` actionable + specific enough that
  a concrete fix can be reached without further re-derivation?

If any check fails, revise the draft (`write_rough_draft`) and re-read
before delivering."""
