"""
CEX-driven CVL remediation sub-agent for the codegen workflow.

Two sub-agents live here:

* ``cex_remediation_tool`` — the codegen author calls this when a prover run
  returns a counterexample whose root cause it has decided needs a CVL-side
  fix (summary, ghost model, invariant) rather than a code change. The
  remediator drafts a proposed full-spec replacement + rationale and returns
  it as a string. The codegen author stays in charge of the working-spec
  flow (``write_working_spec`` → verify → ``commit_working_spec``); the
  remediator never writes to the VFS or runs the prover itself.

* ``summary_critic_tool`` — a sub-agent the remediator can call to
  pre-flight a candidate change for soundness and design-faithfulness.
  Specifically tuned to catch the footguns the codegen author has been
  reaching for: ``_.transfer => NONDET`` (NONDET treats the body as a
  no-op, making every token movement a silent zero-effect call), naked
  ``DISPATCHER`` on ERC20-shaped polymorphic calls, ``persistent`` ghosts
  used to escape HAVOC, etc.

The system document is plumbed into both agents at construction time so
the critic can judge faithfulness of a proposed summary against the
protocol's stated design — not just local CVL soundness.
