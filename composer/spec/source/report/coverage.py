"""Coverage validation for the property-keyed report.

The partition is over **properties** (a claim has exactly one home), not rules — a rule whose
properties span several groups is expected (rules repeat) and reported as an informational stat, not
an error. Hard issues (a property in >1 group, or a group naming a property that doesn't exist) raise
`ValidationError`; `build` catches it and degrades to the single ``general`` bucket, whose shape is
trivially valid so a re-validate cannot raise. Soft issues go into `CoverageReport.warnings`.
