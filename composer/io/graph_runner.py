"""
Low-level graph execution with event emission.

Streams a compiled LangGraph graph and translates each stream item
into an event pushed to the caller-supplied sink.  Handles HITL
interrupts by delegating to a ``human_handler`` callback.

This module knows nothing about queues, handlers, or nesting — it
just writes events to the sink it is given.  The higher-level
``context.run_graph()`` sets up the sink (with nesting support)
and connects it to the ``EventQueue`` / drainer infrastructure.

    """Flatten langgraph's mixed-mode tools-node payload to ``dict[node, dict]``.

    When a ``ToolNode`` batch contains tools whose returns differ in shape
    (some return raw ``ToolMessage`` / ``str`` / dicts; some return
    ``Command(update=...)`` with extra state-channel deltas), langgraph's
    ``_combine_tool_outputs`` emits the node's value as a *list* of separate
    updates instead of a single merged dict — see
    ``langgraph/prebuilt/tool_node.py``. Every downstream ``log_state_update``
    handler in this codebase expects ``dict[node, dict_with_messages]`` and
    silently drops the list shape (either via ``isinstance(update, dict)``
    guards or ``"messages" in update`` membership checks, which return
    ``False`` against a list of dicts/Commands). The result is that any
    ToolMessage produced by a parallel batch with at least one
    ``Command``-returning tool never reaches the renderer — the tool widgets
    stay "pending" until something else forces a redraw.

    Merge here so handlers stay simple. ``messages`` lists are concatenated;
    other state keys retain last-write-wins semantics (matches what
    langgraph's reducers would do for non-message channels, which the
    handlers in this codebase don't introspect for ingest purposes).
