"""The command-sandbox provider seam (``docs/command-sandbox.md`` §4, §7).

Every ``RunCommand`` invocation compiles and/or runs *untrusted native code* (an
LLM-authored harness, a user program's ``build.rs``), so it must run confined —
no network, no inherited secrets, only its own inputs on the filesystem. This
module is the **tool-agnostic isolation layer** that makes that confinement
*swappable*:

- :class:`SandboxPolicy` — the confinement *intent* (rw/ro paths, env allowlist,
  network on/off, resource caps). It names **no mechanism**, so swapping the
  sandbox tool never changes the policy.
- :class:`SandboxProvider` — maps a policy + a command to a concrete
  :class:`LaunchSpec` (the argv/env to actually exec). The mechanism (a
  Landlock+seccomp launcher, or an off-the-shelf tool like ``landrun`` /
  ``sandlock``) lives entirely behind this protocol.

Because :func:`composer.sandbox.command.run_local_command` will depend only on
this seam — never on a concrete tool — a provider can be swapped without touching
the command runner, ``RealEffects``, or the escape-test gate. It lives outside
``rustapp`` so Python-based backends can use it too, not just the Rust-IoC ones.

This module ships the policy, the protocol, the ``none`` passthrough provider,
and the provider registry. The ``run-confined`` launcher provider (Landlock +
seccomp) registers itself under ``"launcher"`` when
:mod:`composer.sandbox.launcher` is imported (typically via
:meth:`composer.sandbox.config.SandboxConfig.resolve_provider`).

**Trust boundary** (``docs/command-sandbox.md`` §7.2): the policy and the emitted
``LaunchSpec`` are authored by trusted Python — never the LLM, which controls only
file *contents*.
