"""LangChain callback that accumulates per-call LLM token usage into the active run.

Attached at model construction (:func:`composer.workflow.services.create_llm_base`)
so it fires for *every* ``invoke`` / ``ainvoke`` through the model — including
``.bind_tools()`` derivatives and out-of-graph side-calls (prover counterexample
analysis, interactive refinement) that never reach the graph's ``StateUpdate`` stream
and so are invisible to the TUI token bar.

``run_inline = True`` keeps dispatch on the event-loop thread (see
``langchain_core.callbacks.manager._ahandle_event_for_handler``): the active-task
context var read by :meth:`RunSummary.record_token_usage` stays visible and the shared
counters are mutated single-threaded (no race). Compatible across the pinned
``langchain_core >=1.2,<1.3.3`` range — uses only the long-stable sync
``BaseCallbackHandler.on_llm_end`` surface.
